Hi - welcome to the Business Continuity Framework.

We've endevoured to streamline the process of creating a fully functional business continuity program based loosely on the NIST 800-34 standard. We believe that most organizations can shorten the processes related to Business Impact Analysis if they will consider a somewhat less precise method that involved workshopping with the business and technical discovery.
Vizius has created a number of workflows and templates that will make it easier to organize discussions, collect data and focus on the actual work required to implement a fully functional program.

START HERE:

Please review the 'BCF - Process Overview Flowchart' and 'Business Continuity Framework - Process Overview' documents to begin.
Refer to vizius.com/bcf for an overview and feel free to reach out to bcf@vizius.com if you have questions and we'll do our best to help where we can.
