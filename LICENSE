THIS LIMITATION IS INTENDED AS AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL LIABILITY OF VIZIUS.  BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Failure to insist upon strict compliance with this License shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any current or future right arising out of this License.  If any provision of this License is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable, and this License shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision had never been a part of this License.
